# This repo is now [archived]
I haven't yet found a workflow that lets me update and test this repo easily along with my other two ports of KISS ([main](https://github.com/arvl130/kiss32-repo), [glibc](https://github.com/arvl130/kiss32-glibc-repo)), so I'm archiving this one for now. Anyone still interested can fork. [Contact me](mailto:angelogeulin123@gmail.com) if you have any further questions.
